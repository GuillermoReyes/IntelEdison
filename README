A cool project using Intel Edison's development board. 

GetTemperature.c uses the mraa library to just get the temperature every couple
of seconds. 

EdisonClient.c, however, reports the temperature, connects to a server at UCLA, 
and allows the server to request changes in output(ie, Celsius vs Fahrenheit).
The server then stops the transmission. Pretty Cool
